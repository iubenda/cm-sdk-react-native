# CMP SDK for React Native

CMP SDK is a React Native library that facilitates the management of user consent for data processing and storage. It is designed to help developers comply with various data protection regulations.

## Installation

```sh
npm install cmp-sdk
```

## Getting Started

### Linking (React Native 0.59 and below)

If you are using React Native 0.59 or below, you need to link the native modules manually:

```bash
react-native link cmp-sdk
```

## Usage

Import the `Consentmanager` from the `cmp-sdk` package in your code:

```jsx
import { Consentmanager } from 'cmp-sdk';
```

### Initializing the SDK

You can initialize the CMP SDK using either the direct configuration or a config object:

- **Direct Initialization:**
  ```jsx
  Consentmanager.createInstance('yourID', 'yourDomain', 'yourAppName', 'yourLanguage');
  ```

- **Initialization using Config Object:**
  ```jsx
  Consentmanager.createInstanceByConfig(yourConfigObject);
  ```

### Managing Consent Layer

To manage the consent layer:

- **Open Consent Layer:**
  ```jsx
  Consentmanager.openConsentlayer();
  ```

### Event Handling

Add event listeners to handle various consent-related events:

```jsx
const removeListeners = Consentmanager.addEventListeners({
  onOpen: () => console.log('Consent layer opened'),
  onClose: () => console.log('Consent layer closed'),
  // Add other event handlers as needed
});
```

Remember to remove the event listeners when they are no longer needed:

```jsx
removeListeners();
```

### Consent Queries

You can check for vendor and purpose consents:

- **Check Vendor Consent:**
  ```jsx
  Consentmanager.hasVendor('vendorID').then((hasConsent) => {
    console.log('Has vendor consent: ', hasConsent);
  });
  ```

- **Check Purpose Consent:**
  ```jsx
  Consentmanager.hasPurpose('purposeID').then((hasConsent) => {
    console.log('Has purpose consent: ', hasConsent);
  });
  ```

### Resetting Consent

To reset the current consent settings:

```jsx
Consentmanager.reset();
```

### Exporting Consent String

Export the current consent string:

```jsx
Consentmanager.exportCmpString().then((cmpString) => {
  console.log('CMP String: ', cmpString);
});
```

## Additional Methods

The CMP SDK provides various methods to retrieve or manage consent data, such as:

- `getAllVendors()`
- `getAllPurposes()`
- `getEnabledVendors()`
- `getEnabledPurposes()`
- `getDisabledVendors()`
- `getDisabledPurposes()`
- `getUSPrivacyString()`
- `getGoogleACString()`

Refer to the SDK documentation for detailed information on these methods.

Remember to replace placeholders like 'yourID', 'yourDomain', etc., with actual values relevant to the users of your SDK. You can also expand each section with more detailed examples if needed.

## Jest mocks
When running jest, you can pass our mock
```js
jest.mock('cmp-sdk', () =>
  require('cmp-sdk/jest/mock'),
);
```
